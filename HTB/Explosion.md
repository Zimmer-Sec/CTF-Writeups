**Overview: In this challenge, we discovered a domain-joined machine that had an Administrator account without a password set and RDP open. We were able to enumerate the domain information and guess our way into a desktop GUI.**

Let's jump into this challenge with a basic nmap scan against all TCP ports using my go-to:    
`nmap -sS -sV -T4 -sC -Pn --disable-arp-ping -n [target ip]`    
Results:

Though, I know this Windows device challenge is going to be tailored towards the RDP service, I want to quickly check out the SMB service to see if there's any data stored on it that might help us with this challenge.    

First step: I'll try and use smbmap to list out any shares and permissions granted to my user WORKGROUP\kali: `smbclient -h [target ip] -u kali`

And just to prove that there's nothing of use in the IPC$ share:

Now we can move onto the RDP service. I first want to go back and make sure I ran all possible RDP scripts in the Nmap Scripting Engine. To do so, I use `locate script/rdp` and then run all with `--script=rdp*:

With this information, let's begin to play with the most popular linux rdp client: xfreerdp3. We can use `xfreerdp3 /u:Administrator /v:10.129.1.13 /dynamic-resolution +clipboard` to attempt to use the usual "Administrator" username.

Using the data from the NMAP script, I guessed the domain name to be "EXPLOSION" like we saw in the NTLM data.

Money! Let me make this full screen thanks to the `/dynamic-resolution`. Also, what's this? A text file called "flag.txt" on the desktop?

Note: Donâ€™t submit the flag that appeared on my screen. It is unique to my account and will cause your account to be flagged for cheating.
