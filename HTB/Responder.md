**Overview: **

Let's begin by running a quick TCP Syn and UDP scan against the top 10,000 ports with no regard for staying silent: `sudo nmap -sS --disable-arp-ping -Pn -p- -sU [target ip] -T5 --top-ports 10000`

Now, let's focus our more intensive version and script scans at those three TCP ports with: `sudo nmap -sT -p 80,5985,7680 -sC -sV -O [target IP]`

No title on that web server... hmm... Let's try and grab the headers with `curl -i -v [url]`

Weird. It's wanting to refresh our page with a "unika.htb" domain that doesn't seem to exist. My next idea is to let gobuster run to try and find directories behind this web server. I'll start with `gudo gobuster dir --url [target ip] --wordlist /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-small.txt --ne -r` (ne = no errors, -r = follow redirects (recursive))

Taking a look at the good results. HTTP status 403 = Forbidden. HTTP status 503 = Maintenance. HTTP status 200 = STATUS OK!

Not much to see, but I'll take note of `Apache/2.4.52 (Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1m PHP/8.1.1 Server`. We may be able to use this information later. Also, I found a Thumbs.db composite document File V2 that I don't currently understand, but we can also come back to this after I look at the other directories.

Theme.js didn't show us much besides the javascript functionality to animated page features.

Nothing out of the ordinary here. Styling sheets for css.

/inc/ included nothing besides some jquery and font libraries.
