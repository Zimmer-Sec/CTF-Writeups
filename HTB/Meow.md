**Overview: Utilizing some core functionalities of Kali linux, we exploited the box's use of passwordless Telnet authentication to gain a root shell.**

Using my own Kali linux VM, I used the openvpn binary to connect to HackTheBox's VIP VPN Server in order to establish a tunnel interface to the victim box. To get our first picture of this device, we can use a basic nmap scan to get an idea using the Syn Stealth (default) and version scan option:

Knowing that telnet is the obvious port that this CTF is wanting us to look at, I can start using nmap's scripting engine (NSE) to look closer. Also knowing that telnet is inherently insecure, transmitting data in plain-text, I want to see if it has encryption enabled.

Looks like `nmap -p 23 --script telnet-encryption 10.129.1.17` provided little info. Knowing this is a linux box (as seen in the first nmap scan), there's no need to look for NTLM data using `--script telnet-ntlm-info`. Let's try to banner this with netcat and retrieve some basic information.

Nothing... Let's move onto testing for the basic anonymous (no username and no password) and passwordless (username and no password) logins used by admins to host public files.  Syntax: `telnet 10.129.1.17 23`

Knowing this is a linux box, we can test root, user, test, and maybe admin/administrator.

Before I could even try to enter a blank password, the passwordless feature gave us a shell as root on the host machine "Meow"!      

We can now begin to look around for something of interest.
