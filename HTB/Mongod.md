**Overview: This challenge led me to my first time interacting with a MongoDB instance. After troubleshooting some legecy client software, I was able to connect without credentials and collect the exposed flag!**

Let's begin this challenge by testing connectivity to the remote target and then throwing a basic syn scan (-sS) with version scanning (-sV) and help scripts (-sC): `nmap -sS -sV -sC [target ip]`

The only service open on the device seems to be OpenSSH 8.2p1. The scan also shows that this is an Ubuntu machine. Let's take a look for any specific vulnerabilities tied to this version:

Being that this doesn't seem like the entire picture I'm supposed to be seeing, I'm going to scan across all (TCP) ports with `-p-`. To speed it up a little, I removed the scripts and version scanning options unitl after I've narrowed down open ports.

The output of the mongodb scripts was a bit overwhelming, but there was transportation security, host, and database information. Interestingly, it shows us thast there are currently eleven active clients. The Javascript engine `mozjs` could also prove useful in finding vulnerabilities.    

In order to access the official MongoDB client, `mongosh`, I'll have to download it with curl: `curl -O https://downloads.mongodb.com/compass/mongodb-mongosh_2.5.8-linux-x64.tgz` followed by `gunzip mongosh-2.5.8-linux-x64.tgz` and `tar -xvf mongosh-2.5.8-linux-x64.tar`

That gives me access to the mongosh binary file found in `~/Downloads/mongosh-2.5.8-linux-x64/bin/`. Now we can finally start to interact with this device.

I noticed that the documentation stated that the server's MongoDB version had to be higher than 4.2 to work with mongosh. While attempting to connect with the basic `mongosh mongodb://[target ip]:27017`, I received an error confirming this.

I found that if I went back to the GUI and downloaded the old 1.10.6 version and went through the same process, I was successful.

The `show dbs` function reaveals what we saw in our nmap scripts output. Database layers: "admin", "config", "local", "sensitive information", and "users". Let's jump right to he juicy stuff and do `use sensitive_information` to mount onto the database.

Remembering that the database uses a hierarchy of Database -> Collection -> Documents (JSON Data), let's look at the collections within this database with `show collections`:

and finally, we can denote that `flag` collection in our next command to list all documents within that collection with `db.flag.find()`:
